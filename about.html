<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Abdulmajid Ibrahim Kedir.
   Iâ€™m an Ethiopian student passionate about technology, 
   currently studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering in Istanbul. 
   I'm working toward switching to Computer Engineering to deepen my knowledge in software development. 
   I enjoy reading in the early morning, exploring programming, 
   and sharing opportunities with others through my scholarship and student support channels.</p>
